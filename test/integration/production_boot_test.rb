  # PRODUCTION BOOT TEST
  # ============================================================================
  # This test ensures the application can start successfully in production mode.
  # It catches environment-specific issues that only manifest in production,
  # such as callbacks that are conditionally defined based on Rails.env.
  #
  # CRITICAL: This test would have caught the Pundit callback bug that caused
  # the December 2025 production outage, where verify_authorized only existed
  # in development/test but controllers tried to skip it in production.
