class MushroomComparisonsController < ApplicationController
  # ============================================================================
  # MUSHROOM COMPARISONS CONTROLLER
  # ============================================================================
  # Manages comparison operations between mushrooms based on character traits.
  #
  # AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION:
  # - Uses Devise for authentication (authenticate_user!)
  # - Users can compare any mushroom (regardless of ownership)
  #
  # PERFORMANCE NOTES:
  # - Comparisons run asynchronously via CompareMushroomsJob
  # - Uses pagination for comparison results
  # - Eager loads associations to prevent N+1 queries
  #
  # KEY ACTIONS:
  # - index: Shows all comparisons for a specific mushroom
  # - show: Shows details of a single comparison
  # - create: Triggers comparison job for a mushroom
  # ============================================================================
