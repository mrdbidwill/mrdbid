class MushroomsController < ApplicationController
  # ============================================================================
  # MUSHROOMS CONTROLLER - User's Personal Mushroom Collection Management
  # ============================================================================
  # This controller manages CRUD operations for mushrooms owned by individual users.
  # Each mushroom belongs to a single user (see app/models/mushroom.rb).
  #
  # AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION:
  # - Uses Devise for authentication (authenticate_user!)
  # - Uses Pundit for authorization (see app/policies/mushroom_policy.rb)
  # - Users can only view/edit/delete their own mushrooms
  #
  # PERFORMANCE NOTES:
  # - Uses eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
  # - Index action uses pagination (25 items per page via Kaminari)
  # - All queries include necessary associations to avoid multiple DB calls
  #
  # ⚠️  CRITICAL AUTHORIZATION FLOW:
  # 1. authenticate_user! runs first (except index - allows public viewing of empty list)
  # 2. set_mushroom loads the record for show/edit/update/destroy
  # 3. authorize_mushroom checks Pundit policy (user must own the mushroom)
  # ============================================================================

  # Pundit setup
  include Pundit::Authorization

  before_action :authenticate_user!, except: [:index] # Ensure user is authenticated first, except for index
  before_action :set_mushroom, only: %i[show edit update destroy]

      # - image_mushrooms.part: Used in _image_card partial (lines 10, 15) for alt text

      # Missing associations cause 500 errors in production due to strict_loading.
