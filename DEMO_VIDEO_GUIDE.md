## RECORDING TIPS

### For Voiceover:
1. **Speak slowly and clearly** - You'll speed it up if needed
2. **Record in quiet room** - Turn off fans, close windows
3. **Use pop filter** or speak slightly off-axis from mic
4. **Record whole script in one take**, then edit out mistakes
5. **Pause 2 seconds between sections** for easier editing

### For Text Captions:
1. **Use large, readable font** (32-40pt)
2. **High contrast** (white text on dark semi-transparent background)
3. **Keep on screen 3-5 seconds** per caption
4. **Position at bottom** of screen, not covering important content
5. **Use bold for key terms** like "Auto-Glossary"

### Cursor Movements:
1. **Move slowly** - Fast cursor looks jerky
2. **Pause briefly** before clicking (1 second)
3. **Smooth movements** - don't jitter
4. **Draw attention** by circling important elements

### Screen Recording Settings:
1. **Record at 60fps** if possible (smoother)
2. **Hide desktop clutter** - record just browser window
3. **Use fullscreen or maximize browser**
4. **Turn off notifications** (Mac: Do Not Disturb)

## EDITING CHECKLIST

After recording, edit to:
- [ ] Remove dead air/long pauses
- [ ] Add background music (soft, non-intrusive)

- [ ] Include intro title card (3 seconds)
- [ ] Include outro with website URL (5 seconds)
- [ ] Export at 1080p, 30fps minimum
- [ ] Keep file size under 100MB

### Recommended Background Music:
- YouTube Audio Library (free, royalty-free)
- Incompetech.com (Kevin MacLeod - free with credit)
- Bensound.com (free for personal use)
- Look for: "tech", "corporate", "upbeat" tags
- Keep volume at 20-30% (don't overpower voice)

---

## FREE EDITING SOFTWARE

### Mac:
- **iMovie** (free, built-in) - Easy for beginners

## ALTERNATIVE: NO-VOICEOVER VERSION

If you're not comfortable with voiceover:

1. **Record silently** with just cursor movements
2. **Add text captions** for all narration
3. **Use background music** throughout
4. **Make captions very clear** and easy to read
5. **Keep on screen longer** (5-7 seconds each)

This actually works great for social media where videos auto-play muted!
