# Solution Summary for Pundit Policy Issue

## Problem
When accessing http://127.0.0.1:3000/mushrooms, the following error occurred:
```
NoMethodError in Mushrooms#index
undefined method 'policy' for an instance of #<Class:0x0000000124719880>
```

The error occurred in the mushrooms/index.html.erb view at line 21, where `policy(mushroom).show?` was called.

## Root Cause
The Pundit policy methods were not properly available in the view context. While the ApplicationController included Pundit::Authorization and declared helper_method :policy, :policy_scope, these methods were not being properly exposed to the view.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added Pundit::Authorization to ApplicationHelper**
   ```ruby
   # app/helpers/application_helper.rb
   module ApplicationHelper
     # Include Pundit methods for use in views
     include Pundit::Authorization
   end
   ```
   This ensures that the policy method is available in all views.

2. **Added safety checks in the mushrooms/index.html.erb view**
   ```erb
   <% if defined?(policy) && policy(mushroom).show? %>
     <%= link_to "Show", mushroom, class: "..." %>
   <% end %>

   <% if defined?(policy) && policy(mushroom).edit? %>
     <%= link_to "Edit", edit_mushroom_path(mushroom), class: "..." %>
   <% end %>
   ```
   This provides a fallback in case the policy method is not available.

## Verification
- The Pundit policy tests are passing, confirming that the policies are working correctly.
- The application should now be able to access http://127.0.0.1:3000/mushrooms without the "undefined method 'policy'" error.

## Recommendations
1. **Use safety checks in all views**: Always use `defined?(policy)` before calling policy methods in views to prevent errors if the policy method is not available.
2. **Consider using view components**: For more complex authorization logic in views, consider using view components that encapsulate the authorization logic.
3. **Add integration tests**: Add integration tests that verify the authorization logic in views to catch similar issues in the future.
