You may see (currently you WILL SEE) some characters that don\'t seem to make any sense. One good explanation is that they DO NOT make any sense <u>as they are currently represented</u>.</p>\n  <p>I made the choice to include every character that I found so that none dropped out of sight and ended up being lost before knowledgeable people could decide their value, or not. Some need more fleshing out by adding data for available options for that specific character so that a radio list or drop-down can be displayed instead of simple text form field.</p>\n  <p>I certainly realize that most people, however dedicated they are to mycology, will never use every or even most of these characters. That does not reduce the value of those rarely used.</p>\n\n      <p class=\"text-gray-800\"><b>You are an admin user.</b> You can view how I kept track of the original source of the characters. Actually, the <b>ORIGINAL source</b> for most of the character list is Mushroom Observer\'s Excited delirium [EXD].</p>\n      <p>I took EXD\'s list and attempted to add what would end up being database tables/rows. For example, original row 2, \"2 The size (height and\n        3 width) of the pileus/pilei\" became row 2 \"pileus_height_mm\" and row 3 \"pileus_width_mm\" (in original source) which ends up in table mr_characters as rows 113 and 114.
